# statistical_BPM_write_error_model
A write error model for exchange coupled composite and single layer bit patterned media islands, written in Matlab. 

The basic routines for calculating demagnetising factors, energy barriers and coercivity have been separated and are contained in the /Basic-Routines/ folder. These form the building blocks of the entire model, but can be used for simpler calculations. Examples of how to use these functions in various combinations are contained in the /Basic-Examples/ folder.
